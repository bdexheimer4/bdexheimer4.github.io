      <h1>Tech Hero: Kimberly Bryant</h1>

      <!-- ✏️ Replace the text inside each <p> with your own writing -->
      <p><strong>Why we chose this person:</strong> We picked Kimberly Bryant because she saw a problem in tech — the lack of opportunities for young women of color — and decided to do something about it. By founding Black Girls CODE, she created a movement that inspires and equips underrepresented students to enter the tech world.</p>

      <p><strong>What they do:</strong> Kimberly Bryant is an electrical engineer who started Black Girls CODE in 2011. The organization offers coding workshops, hackathons, and mentorship for girls of color, with the goal of preparing them for careers in STEM. Bryant has dedicated her career to expanding representation and making sure the next generation of innovators includes more diverse voices. Through her work, she has challenged the norms of who gets to be seen as a “tech leader."</p>

      <p><strong>Impact:</strong> The impact of Black Girls CODE has been incredible. The group has reached thousands of students across the United States and beyond. Many participants say the program gave them confidence, role models, and practical skills that made them want to pursue computer science degrees or tech jobs. By breaking down barriers, Bryant has opened the door for more women of color to join the industry. Her work also forces tech companies to think harder about inclusion and equity when building their own teams.</p>

      <p><strong>What we learned:</strong> Learning about Kimberly Bryant showed us that leadership in tech doesn’t just mean creating a product — it can also mean creating opportunities for others. She didn’t just notice a problem; she built a solution that helps entire communities. For us, this is inspiring because it reminds us that equity and innovation can go hand in hand. We want to carry that mindset into our own work by asking how our ideas can create access and fairness, not just convenience.</p>
