      <h1>Implicit Bias: Quick Guide</h1>
      <p>This guide was created by Ben Dexheimer and Jack Horbach for first-year students. We wanted to make complicated ideas like implicit bias and intersectionality easier to understand, and provide helpful links.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Definition #1 -->
    <section>
      <h2>What is Implicit Bias?</h2>
      <p>Implicit bias means the quick judgments or associations we make without even realizing it. These hidden biases can affect how we see and treat people. Everyone has them, and the goal is to notice them and try to limit their effect on our actions.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Definition #2 -->
    <section>
      <h2>Intersectionality</h2>
      <p>Intersectionality is the idea that people’s identities overlap, like race, gender, class, or disability, and those overlaps shape their experiences. For example, someone might experience challenges differently if they are both a woman and a person of color. Thinking about intersectionality helps us avoid one-size-fits-all solutions.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- IBT explanation + links (external) -->
    <section>
      <h2>Implicit Bias Test (IBT)</h2>
      <p>The IBT is an online tool that shows some of the hidden associations we might have. The results don’t label you — they’re just a way to start noticing patterns. The main point is to reflect on what you learn and think about small changes you can make moving forward.</p>

      <h2>First Steps to Act</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Take the IBT and write one surprise and one change you’ll try this week.</li>
        <li>When working on projects, ask: “Who could be left out?”</li>
        <li>Practice using inclusive words and check in with others.</li>
      </ul>
