      <h1>Implicit Bias: Quick Guide</h1>
      <p>We put this guide together to make terms like implicit bias and intersectionality easy for first-year students to understand. Here are simple definitions and links if you want to learn more.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Implicit Bias -->
    <section>
      <h2>What is Implicit Bias?</h2>
      <p><strong>Implicit bias</strong> refers to automatic, often unconscious associations that can influence how we see and treat others. Everyone has them; the work is to notice and reduce their impact.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Intersectionality -->
    <section>
      <h2>Intersectionality</h2>
      <p><strong>Intersectionality</strong> looks at how parts of identity (race, gender, class, disability, sexuality, etc.) overlap to shape experience. It helps us avoid one-size-fits-all assumptions and design more inclusive solutions.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- IBT -->
    <section>
      <h2>Implicit Bias Test (IBT)</h2>
      <p>The IBT (from Project Implicit) helps reveal automatic associations. Treat results as a starting point for reflection, not a label. Use them to set small goals and track change over time.</p>

    <!-- First Steps -->
    <section>
      <h2>First Steps to Act</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>After an IBT, write one surprise and one behavior change to try this week.</li>
        <li>In projects, ask: “Who might be excluded?” and “How can we adapt?”</li>
        <li>Use inclusive language; invite feedback; keep learning.</li>
